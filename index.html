<body><p> My name is <b>Brandan</b>. I will correct you if it is any other way. I am 19 years old, and I have autism and ADHD.</p>
<br><p> I <b>will</b> make mistakes. <b>That is normal for me and any other human to do.</b> Please tell me if I ever make a mistake, whether it be inappropriate messages, or just something I shouldn't be doing.</p>
<p> Do not chastise me for the mistakes I make, or I will block you. Plain and simple instructions to follow. </p>
<br><p> If I seem like I'm having a bad day or just feeling overall down, please reach out. It'd be a good idea. I, however do not permit myself to interact with people who I consider to be annoying or just overall an asshole.  </p>
<p> If you believe any block I have made is in error, please use my email, which is <b style="color: greenyellow;">brandan(at)dfuser(dot)xyz</b>.</p>
<br><p> I am a programmer for Osaka Simulator ver. Roblox, a game I'm currently help make with my friends. I'm on some old Roblox revivals, and I don't have much of a social media presence other than Twitter.</p>
